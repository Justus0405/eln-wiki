# Switches & Relays

> [!INFO]
> Switches and relays provide electrical isolation between control and load circuits.
> When a switch or relay is open, no current flows. When closed, current can flow freely.
> Each voltage tier has its corresponding switches and relays.

## Switches

Electrical switches are devices used to open or close an electrical circuit, allowing or interrupting the flow of current.

| Switch Opened                                                        | Switch Closed                                                        |

## Relays

Relays are electrically operated switches that use an electromagnet to open or close a circuit. They are controlled via a [signal](/1-beginner/signaling.md) from the side. Pressing right-click on a relay allows to change the default state of the relay to make it either open or close when a signal is recieved.

| Relay Opened                                                        | Relay Closed                                                        |
