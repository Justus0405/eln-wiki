# Switches & Relays

Switches and relays provide electrical isolation between control and load circuits. When a switch or relay is open, no current flows. When closed, current can flow freely.
Each voltage tier has its corresponding switches and relays.

# Switches

Electrical switches are devices used to open or close an electrical circuit, allowing or interrupting the flow of current.

# Relays

Relays are electrically operated switches that use an electromagnet to open or close a circuit. They are controlled via a [signal](/1-beginner/signal-cables.md) from the side.

| Relay Opened                                                        | Relay Closed                                                        |
