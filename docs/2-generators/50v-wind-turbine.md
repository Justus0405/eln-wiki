## About

The Wind Turbine produces up to 160W at around 50V, depending on wind strength. It is one of the easiest ways to generate power.

## Connection

The Wind Turbine has one connector for low voltage cables at the back. If you need a higher voltage, use a [transformer](/1-beginner/transformers.md).

## Positioning

The higher you place the Wind Turbine, the better it will work. Try to place it on a hill or build a tower. Wind speed is strongest at Y100, so that is the best height for maximum performance.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure nothing blocks the airflow. There should be no blocks in front or behind the turbine.

> [!TIP]
> Power output is usually higher during rain or storms. The maximum power is 160W.
> The normal output is about 15 to 35W. Sometimes it can go higher, but this is not common. The power is often unstable.
