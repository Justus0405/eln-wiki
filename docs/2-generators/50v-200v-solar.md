## About

Solar panels turn sunlight into electricity. They work less effectively in the morning and evening. There are two main types: Static Solar Panels and Rotating Solar Panels.

> [!WARNING]
> Panels should not be blocked by other objects, or they will produce less electricity.

## Rotating Panels

Rotating Solar Panels track the sun and generate electricity more efficiently than static panels. To follow the sun automatically, they need a Solar Tracker. They can also be adjusted by hand if a tracker is not available.

## Connection

Each panel has a red positive side and a blue negative side. The negative side must connect to ground and the positive side provides the power.

When panels are connected in series, the voltage adds up. For example, three small panels in series can produce 44.4 volts.
