## About

The Water Turbine produces up to 30W at around 50V. It is **the** easiest ways to generate power.

## Connection

The Water Turbine has one connector for low-voltage cables at the back. If you need a higher voltage, use a [transformer](1-beginner/transformers.md).

## Positioning

The Water Turbine fins should touch the moving water, which is enough to start generating power.
