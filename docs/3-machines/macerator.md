# Macerator

> [!INFO]
> A machine that grinds items into dust.

## About

The macerator grinds ores into two dust and ingots into one dust. It also works with most ores, ingots, and dusts from other mods. This is a type of ore duplication available early in the game.

Other uses:

- Sand gives one silicon dust.
- Coal gives two coal dust.
- Cobblestone gives one gravel.
- Gravel gives one flint.
- Dirt gives one sand.

## Power Usage

Without upgrades, the 50V macerator has a resistance of 12.5 ohms and uses 4 Amperes. The 200V macerator has a resistance of 100 ohms and uses 2 Amperes. Because of the limits of low voltage and medium voltage cables, you should only place up to 5 macerators on one circuit that has no other machines.

## Upgrades

You can add a [Machine Booster](/3-machines/machine-booster.md) to make the machine faster, but this increases power use.
