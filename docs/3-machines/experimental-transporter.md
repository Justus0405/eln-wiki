# Experimental Transporter

## About

The Transporter lets you move yourself or other things from one machine to another. It cannot work between dimensions, but it is still very useful.

## Usage

Press the Start button to begin. The machine will take the first thing that enters it. You can walk in yourself or throw an item inside. After a few seconds, the door will close and power will flow into the machine. When enough power is stored, it will send you or the item to the other transporter.

Be careful when using it on yourself. If power stops during transport, you may end up in the wrong place or even in danger. Longer trips use more energy and fail more often. Test first with an item to see if the energy bar fills fully.

> [!TIP]
> There is no hit box under the machine. You can dig under it and place lava for a trap.

## Electrical

Connect the machine to an 800V power source using one or more of the three connectors. The machine can pull power from several networks at once so no single one is overloaded.

You also need another transporter to send things to. Get that machine’s name, open this machine’s menu, and enter the name in the slot. You may also add this machine’s name to the other machine. Choose how fast the power is drawn. Faster draw means quicker transport but needs a strong network. If power drops too low, you may end up in a random spot.

## Applications

Transporters need both a start and an end machine. A single solar panel can receive but not send because it cannot supply enough energy.

For two-way travel, build a large solar array, like a 15x15 setup with a 1:4 transformer. As long as you keep the power draw low, you can travel any time in the day. If the other side does not have a full setup, you cannot return.

If you do not want to build large solar arrays, you can also use batteries or generators that turn on only when needed.
