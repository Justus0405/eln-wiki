# Magnetizer

> [!INFO]
> Turns iron and other ferrous items into magnets.

## Recipes

The magnetizer can:

- Turn two iron ingots into a Basic Magnet using 5 kJ of energy
- Turn two alloy ingots into an Advanced Magnet using 15 kJ

The Basic Magnet is not used for anything yet.

## Power Usage

Without upgrades, the 50 V and 200 V magnetizers have internal resistance of 12.5 Ohms and 100 Ohms. They draw 4 and 2 Amperes. Based on the capacity of low voltage and medium voltage cables, it is safe to connect up to 5 magnetizers to a circuit that has no other load.

## Upgrades

You can add a [Machine Booster](/3-machines/machine-booster.md) to make the machine faster, but this increases power use.
