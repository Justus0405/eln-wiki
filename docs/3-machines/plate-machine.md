# Plate Machine

> [!INFO]
> Used to hammer ingots into plates.

## Recipes

The plate machine uses a set amount of resources to make plates. The ratio can be changed, but by default one ingot makes one plate. Each operation always uses 10kJ of energy.

- Copper Ingot to Copper Plate
- Lead Ingot to Lead Plate
- Silicon Ingot to Silicon Plate
- Alloy Ingot to Alloy Plate
- Iron Ingot to Iron Plate
- Gold Ingot to Gold Plate

## Upgrades

You can add a [Machine Booster](/3-machines/machine-booster.md) to make the machine faster, but this increases power use.
