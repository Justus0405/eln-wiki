# Switches & Relays

Electrical switches are devices used to open or close an electrical circuit, allowing or interrupting the flow of current.

Relays are electrically operated switches that use an electromagnet to open or close a circuit. They allow a low-power signal to control a high-power load.

Relays and switches provide electrical isolation between control and load circuits. Each voltage tier comes with a relay.
