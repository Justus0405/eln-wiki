## Usage

Paint brushes can be used to color-code cables, no matter the tier. Color-coded cables will only connect to cables with the same color. This behavior can be toggled, however, by right-clicking a cable while holding the wrench key (default = C).

Because electrical components like [switches and relays](/1-beginner/switches-and-relays.md) canâ€™t be painted, they connect to every cable, regardless of color.
